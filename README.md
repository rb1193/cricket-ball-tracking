# Some ball tracking stuff I was mucking about with

Requires python 3.8

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies. I would recommend using a virtualenv.

Run `python3 track_color.py -v {path_to_video}` to run the tracker. I'd suggest using an edited video in which the ball is already clearly in shot at the start
